        Nashik, located in the state of Maharashtra, India, faces significant challenges related to air quality. Despite being known for its natural beauty and religious significance, Nashik experiences air pollution due to various factors.

Factors Affecting Air Quality:

1. Urbanization: Nashik has witnessed rapid urbanization and population growth, leading to increased vehicular traffic, industrial activities, and construction, which contribute to air pollution.

2. Industrial Pollution: The presence of industries in and around Nashik results in emissions of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), further deteriorating air quality in the region.

3. Agricultural Activities: Agricultural practices in the surrounding areas, including crop residue burning, add to the air pollution burden, especially during certain seasons.

4. Geographical Factors: Nashik's geographical location and topography can influence air quality, with factors such as wind patterns and atmospheric conditions affecting the dispersion and concentration of pollutants.

Health Impacts:

Poor air quality in Nashik has adverse effects on public health. Exposure to high levels of air pollution can lead to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues. Vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are particularly at risk.
