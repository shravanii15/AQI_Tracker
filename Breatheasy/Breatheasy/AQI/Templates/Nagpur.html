        Nagpur, located in the state of Maharashtra, India, experiences various challenges concerning air quality. Despite being recognized as one of the cleanest cities in India, Nagpur still grapples with air pollution issues due to several contributing factors.

Factors Affecting Air Quality:

1. Urbanization: Nagpur has undergone rapid urbanization, leading to increased vehicular traffic, industrial activities, and construction, which contribute to air pollution.

2. Industrial Emissions: The presence of industries in and around Nagpur results in the emission of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), affecting air quality.

3. Biomass Burning: Agricultural practices, including crop residue burning in neighboring regions, contribute to air pollution, especially during certain seasons.

4. Geographical Factors: Nagpur's geographical location and topography influence air quality, with factors like weather patterns and atmospheric conditions affecting pollutant dispersion.

Health Impacts:

Poor air quality in Nagpur can have adverse health effects on its residents. Exposure to high levels of air pollution can lead to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and exacerbation of existing health conditions. Vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory illnesses are particularly at risk.
