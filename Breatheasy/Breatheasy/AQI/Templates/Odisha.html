        Odisha, located on the eastern coast of India, faces various challenges related to air quality. The state, known for its diverse landscape and rich cultural heritage, experiences air pollution from multiple sources.

Factors Affecting Air Quality:

1. Industrial Emissions: Odisha's industrial sector, particularly in cities like Rourkela, Jharsuguda, and Angul, contributes to air pollution through emissions of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM).

2. Vehicular Pollution: Increasing vehicular traffic in urban areas, including cities like Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, leads to emissions of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), contributing to poor air quality.

3. Agricultural Practices: Agricultural activities such as crop burning and use of fertilizers and pesticides release pollutants into the air, especially during certain seasons, further deteriorating air quality in rural areas.

4. Biomass Burning: Burning of biomass for cooking and heating purposes, particularly in rural and tribal areas, adds to air pollution levels, especially during winter months.

5. Geographical Factors: Factors such as topography and weather patterns influence air quality in Odisha. Coastal areas may experience better air quality due to sea breezes, while inland areas may face higher pollution levels.

Health Impacts:

Poor air quality in Odisha can have adverse health effects on its residents. Exposure to air pollution increases the risk of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues. Vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are particularly at risk.
